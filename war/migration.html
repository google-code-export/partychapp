Partychat is currenly built on Google
AppEngine. <a href="http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/2011/05/year-ahead-for-google-app-engine.html">Upcoming</a>
<a href="http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/2011/09/few-adjustments-to-app-engines-upcoming.html">changes</a>
to the AppEngine pricing model will make it too expensive for us to
continue using AppEngine so we are migrating to
Amazon&lsquo;s <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Elastic Cloud Computing</a>.
</p>
<p>
All of your
room state will be preserved in the migration, but you will now interact
with your room via <i>roomname</i>@<b>im.partych.at</b> instead of the old
<i>roomname</i>@partychapp.appspotchat.com.
</p>

<p>
In order to keep our costs from growing too quickly in the future, we may soon start to impose additional restrictions
such as limiting the size of rooms and the number/size of messages posted. Be sure to follow <a href="http://twitter.com/partychat">@partychat</a> on Twitter for additional updates!
</p>

<p>Thanks for your understanding, long live Partychat!</p>
