If your channel has been migrated, and you cannot access it from a Google 
Apps-controlled domain (i.e. not user@gmail.com), here is <a href="http://www.vijayp.ca/blog/?p=152">a description of how to get partychat working with Google Apps domains.</a>
</p>
<p>
Partychat is currenly built on Google
AppEngine. <a href="http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/2011/05/year-ahead-for-google-app-engine.html"></a>
<a href="http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/2011/09/few-adjustments-to-app-engines-upcoming.html">Changes</a>
to the AppEngine pricing model has made it too expensive for us to
continue using AppEngine. We are migrating to
Amazon&lsquo;s <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Elastic Cloud Computing</a>.
</p>
<p>
All of your
room state will be preserved in the migration, but you will now interact
with your room via <i>roomname</i>@<b>im.partych.at</b> instead of the old
<i>roomname</i>@partychapp.appspotchat.com.
</p>

<p>
We are rolling this change out slowly, so please keep using your old room until you are notified via IM. Rooms with
more than 100 members remain temporarily disabled during this transition. We hope to re-enable them as soon as possible -- but 
in order to keep our costs from growing too quickly in the future, we may impose/maintain additional restrictions
such as limiting the size of rooms and the number/size of messages posted. 

</p>
<p>Be sure to follow <a href="http://twitter.com/partychat">@partychat</a> on Twitter for additional updates!
</p>

<p>Thanks for your understanding, long live Partychat!</p>
